# JS-LibraryMgtSystem

## Library Management System
This is a mini library management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with functional programming principles. The system allows users to add, update, and delete books, as well as view books, authors, and publishers.

## Project Requirements
List all the books.
Books can be updated or deleted.
List all the Authors on a different page along with several books written by them.
List Publishers on a different page along with several books they published.
Both Authors and Publishers can be deleted which in turn would also delete corresponding books.
All the data should be persisted in local storage.
Validation checks especially on duplicate entries while adding or updating.
Making the Project Mobile Responsive is a bonus for you otherwise no need to do it.
Use Functional Programming.
Converting Project to PWA (Progressive Web Application) is a bonus for you otherwise no need to do it.
